# GodotPlayground3D
 This is a playground for various godot features, listed below, all tied to a single FPS controller 
 I intend to add more mechanics to this repository as I learn more about Godot. 
 This project uses Godot 4.1.3 (stable). 
 
# How to Install
 1. Download the project files from this repository
 2. Download and Install Godot 4.1.3 (stable) from https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.1.3-stable/
 3. Import the .godot file extension in the project directory
 4. Start a playtest in the Main.tscn in order to access all mechanics

# Movement Mechanics
- WASD to move
- Mouse to aim camera
- ALT to turn head while walking/sprinting (to look over your shoulder as your being chased, for example)
- Shift to Sprint
- CTRL to Crouch
- Space to Jump (3 Jumps available, resets on ground touch)
- Crouch while Sprinting to Slide
- Head Bobbing Animation when walking, sprinting, and crouching
- Q to deploy Grappling Rope

 # Interaction Mechanics
- Left Click to Pick up Objects
- R to Rotate picked up objects
- F to Throw picked up objects
- E to Interact with Interactable Objects (Chests, Doors, Levers, etc.)

  # Inventory Mechanics
- I to open Inventory/Equipment Menu
- Consumable Items are consumed by right clicking on them (or when keyed in via hotbar)
- Equipment Items can be placed in your Equipment Inventory to gain their effects 
- Number Keys 1 ~ 5 for quick access to Items placed on hot bar
- Items can stack, can be placed one by one (right click while holding)
- Dragging an item outside of the inventory window will drop it on the ground
- Walk over items to pick them up. (Items that can be placed in your inventory look like 2d planes that rotate)
